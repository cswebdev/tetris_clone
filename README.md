# Tetris Clone

Hey there :) Thanks for checking out my project! This game is a clone of the classic Tetris game built using ReactJS.

## Gameplay
Tetris is a classic puzzle game. 

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tetrominoes (blocks).
- Press the down arrow key to accelerate their descent.
- Press Space button to fast drop the blocks.
  
Try to complete horizontal lines with the tetrominoes to clear them and score points.
The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the grid.

If you want to code the project yourself like I did, follow the YouTube tutorial made by Restful Coder. It's a really fun project! </br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCEIgEOZ36g

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Clone the projecet
Copy the one of the following git commands and paste it into your terminal to clone the project using your preferred method.

### HTTPS: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tetris-clone.git
```

### SSH: 
```
git@github.com:cswebdev/tetris_clone.git
```

### Navigate to the project
```
cd tetris_clone
```
### Install dependencies
The only dependecides I added were an updated babel script package. No other npm packages were installed. You will need to get the updated babel script. 

```
npm install
```

### Run the game! 

```
npm start
```



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
